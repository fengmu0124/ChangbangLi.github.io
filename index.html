						<li>
							<strong>Lab Project: Improved Recursion and Insertion Sort(Risc-V Assembly)(CS230/CS231
								Computer Organization)</strong>
							<br>1. <em>Fib with Improved Recursion:</em> Run the current implementation of fib with an
							input of 20, obtain its instruction statistics (assume N1 instructions in total). Identify
							the inefficiency in the current fib implementation and make improvements. Run the improved
							fib (named fib2.asm) with the same input and obtain its instruction statistics (assume N2
							instructions in total). Calculate the improvement ratio as N1/N2 (rounded to an integer).
							<br>2. <em>Insertion Sort (isort):</em> Locate the appropriate position in the sorted part
							on the left and insert x, ensuring that elements to the left of x are all smaller or equal
							to x, and elements to the right of x are larger. Repeat this process until all elements are
							sorted. Implement the recursive version of isort (named isort.asm) and input a sequence of
							characters from a-z (no duplicates) on the console. Use the given sequences to run isort.asm
							and observe the output, verifying its accuracy. Obtain instruction statistics for isort.asm
							for the provided sequences.

							<strong>Simple App Development - Project</strong>
							<br>This project revolves around the creation of a straightforward application, boasting
							functionalities such as a text unit for display and a numeric input keyboard. As users key
							in the relevant numbers, the application is designed to reflect this input within its text
							unit. A pivotal feature involves the 'send' button, which, upon being clicked, ensures the
							numbers showcased within the text unit are stored within the phone's physical storage
							address. A significant highlight is the app's capability to detect and prompt when numbers
							diverging from an 8 or 13-digit format are entered, preventing their storage.
							<br>Instructed by Ben Ye, Macau University of Science and Technology.
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong>Online Collaborative Editor</strong>
							<br>Design and development of an innovative online collaborative editor, tailored to
